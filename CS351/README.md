There were TWO tasks in Lab 7 to do:

1. Write a procedure named init which has
```
Input Parameter: p, int(11);
Output Parameter: None.
```
Add to the relation of Project a new attribute Hours whose type is float if there is no such an attribute. Then initialize the value of attribute “Hours” with 0.0 for the tuple with Pnumber = *p*.

2. Write a procedure named stat (which has no parameter) to find out the minimum *(pmin)* and maximum *(pmax)* Pnumber of a project in table PROJECT. For each integer *p* in the range of [*pmin,pmax*], calculate the total number of hours invested to the project by different employees and then update attribute “Hours” of the corresponding project with Pnumber *p*. Note that if there is no employee works on a specific project, the Hours should be set to 0.
