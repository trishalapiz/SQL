# SQL
This repository contains the SQL/T-SQL/MySQL exercises I have done in 2nd/3rd year Information Systems (InfoSys). 

In second year InfoSys, I was taught basic SQL (InfoSys222) and ran the code on a DB Browser for SQLite.

For third year, I was taught MySQL (CompSci351) and T-SQL (InfoSys330), with knowledge from second year.
