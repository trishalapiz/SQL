# SQL
This repository contains the SQL exercises I have done in 2nd/3rd year Information Systems (InfoSys). It also includes T-SQL.

In second year InfoSys, I was taught basic SQL (InfoSys222) and ran the code on a DB Browser for SQLite.

For third year InfoSys, I was taught MySQL (CompSci351) and T-SQL (InfoSys330), with knowledge from second year.
